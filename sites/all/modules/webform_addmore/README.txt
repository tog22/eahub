Description
-------------
Webform Add More enables selected fieldsets to be initially hidden and 
progressively shown with an Add more button, mimicking CCK multiple fields. The
approach and code was proposed by span and improved by kranklin [1]. This 
module adds a checkbox setting to webform fieldset components to select which 
should have Add more functionality, as well as an advanced setting to override 
the button label per Webform.
